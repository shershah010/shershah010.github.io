# Computational Approaches to Human Learning (CAHL) Research

## Web Developer

### October 2018 - Present

CAHLR is a laboratory that develops AskOski which is a web application that helps UC Berkeley students find new courses to take that may interest them. Using various machine learning tools and student enrollment data, AskOski can generate classes that students may be interested in, or ones that fulfill degree requirements, or even courses that the students find serendipitous.

## What I Did

* Migrate CSS to SASS, condensing over 2000 lines of redundant code

* Develop a feature tour API and implement over key tools of the site

* Integrate Material-UI, the most popular React UI framework, onto the site

* Trained on agile project methodologies and CI/CD

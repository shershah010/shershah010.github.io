# Cabrillo Marine Aquarium

## Researcher

### September 2015 - March 2017

Cabrillo Marine Aquarium serves to educate the community of San Pedro about the ocean and the issues that effect the ocean. The Aquarium also runs a program where Ph.D students mentor high school students and supervise research conducted by the students.

## What I Did

* Designed an award-winning experiment testing the effects of temperature on phytoplankton during the chlorination process

* Used quantitative analysis to conclude that temperature has no effect on the chlorination process

# Kumon

## Tutor

### June 2016 - July 2017

Kumon is a tutoring service that helps students from Pre-K to twelfth in math and English. Because tutors and students are paired one-to-one, students get a specialized instruction and learn at their own pace. This leads most students to surpass their grade level. 

## What I Did

* Tutored 50+ students in math, literature, and grammar

* Trained and supervised a team of 10 tutors

* Maintained business records and preformed business accountancy

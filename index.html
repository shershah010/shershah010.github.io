            <p>AskOski is a site that uses machine learning to connect students with classes that they will probably enjoy. As a web developer for AskOski, my work has been interesting, impactfuly, and varied. I created an NPM library called Fishing Tour in pure <b>JavaScript</b> which provided a tutorial to all users entering the site. I have also converted all CSS to <b>SASS</b> giving the site flexabilty when expanding to differnt schools. Lastly, I designed the front end to the four year plan feature which allows students to build their perfect college plan. I learned the ins and outs of <b>Angular-JS</b> and <b>typescript</b>.</p>

            <h3>Fishing Tour</h3>
            <p>Part of my job at AskOski was to create a tutorial for our site. To do this, I authored an NPM packaged called fishing-tour to help quickly create tutorials and tips that are scalable and stable. Fishing-tour is made from <b>vanilla</b> JS and CSS. The package uses no dependancies whatsoever.</p>

            <h3>Scheme Text Editor</h3>
            <p>In my intro to computer science class, we had to create an interpeter for the Scheme programming lanugage. Because of this project, I decided to create a text editor that allowed me to develop a text editor to go along with it. This editor allowed users to read, write, update, and save scheme files. It also provided some color coating to help match all of the parenthases. The scheme text editor was created in <b>Java</b> and uses JavaFX as well as the <b>fxmisc</b> library to style the text.</p>
